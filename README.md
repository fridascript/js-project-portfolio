Tips & tricks
Before starting to code, consider what components you need and break the design up into reusable and manageable pieces.
Consider how you will get the data, e.g. the projects and articles. We set up a JSON file that you can use for your project.
To use the icons from the Figma design, simply mark the icon you want to export and save it as an SVG or copy the code and make it into a component.
Remember that your portfolio will continue to evolve and grow as you progress in your coding journey. Happy coding!
